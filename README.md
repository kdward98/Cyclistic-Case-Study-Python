### About the company
Cyclistic is a successful bike sharing company based in Chicago that launched in 2016. The program has grown to a fleet of 5824 bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. Cyclistics marketing strategy primarily relied on building awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments with the appeal of the flexibility of pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. The Director of Marketing has set a goal to create design marketing strategies that could convert casual riders into annual members as it would be more profitable for the company than the single ride and full day passes. This would be sure to bring forth growth to the Cyclistic bike- share company.

### Key Takeaways
The most popular hours for bike rides are the 15th -18th (3pm-6pm) hours of the day with the highest amount being at the 17th hour(5pm) then decreasing directly after the 18th hour.
There's a noticeable increase in the average rides per day with a weekly consideration as the lowest number of rides are in the Fall/Winter months(November to December) with the highest number of rides being in the summer months(July and August).
Classic bikes and electric bikes are the most widely used bike types with classic bike numbers peaking in the summer months in addition to electric bikes while docked bikes make a very slight appearance in use from casual riders only.
Average ride length for members is pretty consistent compared to casual riders. Casual riders have a higher average ride length over the 12 month time frame.
On a yearly average, members outweighed casual riders by nearly 2x more as total of members amounted at 3,564,512 while casual riders amounted at 2,005,750
The bike demand is highest on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays for casual riders and members collectively with peak hours being between the 15th-18th hours of the day. However there's a distinct difference in the amount of casual riders during weekdays versus the weekend ( Saturday and Sunday) being more occupied for casual riders.

### Recommendations
Cyclistic Company should consider giving rider discounts on weekends to full membership riders as most casual members ride primarily on weekends.
Company should also consider giving discounts within the winter months of the year to potentially optimize sales more in this time frame but also allowing casual members to have a better feel for the program and maybe take full membership access into consideration even more.
Cyclistic company should consider adding an eco-friendly option of a bike type to the roster to see if riders would be more prone to convert after gaining additional analysis on the rider types and frequency of use.
Company should consider adding a higher number of classic bikes to stations and electric bikes to stations considering that they are the most considered bikes on the Cyclistic roster.
Implementation of a loyalty program could be considered with incentives that would be likely to attract higher amounts of users on weekends and weekdays for casual riders overall.
