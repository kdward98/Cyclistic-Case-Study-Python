### About the company
Cyclistic is a successful bike sharing company based in Chicago that launched in 2016. The program has grown to a fleet of 5824 bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. Cyclistics marketing strategy primarily relied on building awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments with the appeal of the flexibility of pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. The Director of Marketing has set a goal to create design marketing strategies that could convert casual riders into annual members as it would be more profitable for the company than the single ride and full day passes. This would be sure to bring forth growth to the Cyclistic bike- share company.
